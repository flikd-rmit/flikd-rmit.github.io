                                    Ideal jobs for five out of six of the team are very similar; they all require skills and knowledge pertaining to navigating and mastering the  “binary” world. The sixth ideal job, which is Medical Scientist is a bit different from the rest since it is more clinically or health related. However there are similarities like displaying excellent communication skills, interpersonal skills, leadership and innovation. For instance, having incredible communication, interpersonal and leadership skills enable the medical scientist to establish dialogue with patients and clinicians regarding diagnostic tests, patient monitoring, treatment and care; IT consultant, manager to demonstrate inspiring leadership qualities to employees and clients; Program developer, IT support and Ux designer to clearly capture the “needs”of the clients and maintain lasting networking relationships with users.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    The major difference is that having a background knowledge, skills and necessary qualification in Informational Technology is an absolute must for the IT consultant, manager, program developer, Ux designer and IT support officer. However, for Medical Scientist, knowledge in navigating the IT world is very important but not as highly prioritized as knowledge and skills in Laboratory Medicine. In saying that, an in-depth understanding of Information Technology is still extremely important when undergoing medical research and setting up network with other medical professionals around the globe.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    The plans of achieving these goals are similar. That is, enroll in University courses pertaining to IT field or Laboratory Medicine, graduate, get qualified, acquire work experience, work smart (and hard!) and climb the corporate ladder, be innovative, be inspired-never stop learning and always strive to be your best self in order to make your dreams a reality.
